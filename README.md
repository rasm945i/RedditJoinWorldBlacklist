A guy on Reddit had issues with his Hunger Games Plugin https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/1h83msg/change_join_location_in_a_specific_world/
People would disconnect mid-game, get removed from the event, re-join and spawn into the Hunger Games event world and cause havoc.
This plugin prevents users from spawning in the event world on join and thus fixes the issue.
